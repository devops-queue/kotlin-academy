fun main() {
  //type that comes from Java and has unknown nullability is a special type in Kotlin:
  // it is called a platform type.
  // the exercise here is to get type clear and make sure nullability is known asap

  // Always specify (cast) a type on Val, better than not doing it to avoid type! (platform type)

  // use annotation in java for non-nullable/nullable declaration asap and use casting as early as possible in Intellij
